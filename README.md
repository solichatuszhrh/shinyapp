This will show you a Shiny app hosted by Github. The step to create a Shiny app in RStudio are:
1. Create a new project for Shiny app
2. Determine UI for application that draws histogram, map, line trend, etc
3. Define also the server logic required
4. Run the application

If you want to access it locally in your computer through RStudio, you can simply use this code `runGitHub(repo = "shinyapp", username = "solichatuszhrh", ref = "main")`
